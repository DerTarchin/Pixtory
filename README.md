# Pixtory
Map out all your photos not by name, date or metadata, but by color! Analyzes over 16m colors in all photos.

Watch the demo/documentation here: https://vimeo.com/184268677

To run, create a folder for all of your photos (/imgs), run analyze.py, then run a simpleHTTPServer command (Pixtory file is a bash script) and head over to localhost:8000! Simple I guess.
